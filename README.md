# Barrier identification

The *hidden_barrier_lidar_mapping* respository is built to contain sample procedures for identifying hidden barriers within stream networks. Examples in this repository are confined to the Snohomish watershed in Western Washington, but are designed to be widely applicable to any area with lidar coverage. Lidar data used in this project is too large to be stores within github, but can be accessed through the [**Washington State Lidar Repository**](https://lidarportal.dnr.wa.gov/)

## Repository Structure

- /code
  - code/Lidar_filter: Procedures for loading in lidar data and filtering to remove roads from point cloud, along with creating DTMs for hydro enforcement procedures
